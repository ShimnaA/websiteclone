<h1>Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for
maintaining its state.  Class instances can also have methods (defined by its
class) for modifying its state.</h1>

<p>Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together.  Creating
a new class creates a new <em>type</em> of object, allowing new <em>instances</em> of that
type to be made.  Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for
maintaining its state.  Class instances can also have methods (defined by its
class) for modifying its state.</p>

<p>(Lacking universally accepted terminology to talk about classes, I will make
occasional use of Smalltalk and C++ terms.  I would use Modula-3 terms, since
its object-oriented semantics are closer to those of Python than C++, but I
expect that few readers have heard of it.)</p>
<h2>This provides semantics for
importing and renaming.  Unlike C++ and Modula-3, built-in types can be used as
base classes for extension by the user.  Also, like in C++, most built-in
operators with special syntax</h2>
